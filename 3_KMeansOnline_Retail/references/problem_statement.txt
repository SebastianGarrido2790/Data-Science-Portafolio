Problem Statement

Many small online retailers and new entrants to the online retail sector are keen to practice data mining and consumer-centric marketing in their businesses yet technically lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so. 
In this project a case study of using data mining techniques in customer-centric business intelligence for an online retailer is presented. 
The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively. 
On the basis of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, customers of the business have been segmented into various meaningful groups using the k-means clustering algorithm, and the main characteristics of the consumers in each segment have been clearly identified. 
Accordingly a set of recommendations is further provided to the business on consumer-centric marketing. 

Compared with traditional shopping in retail stores, online shopping has some unique characteristics: each customer's shopping process and activities can be tracked instantaneously and accurately, each customer's order is usually associated with a delivery address and a billing address, and each customer has an online store account with essential contact and payment information. 
These desirable, special online shopping characteristics have enabled online retailers to treat each customer as an individual with personalized understanding of each customer and to build upon customer-centric business intelligence.

    - In relation to customer-centric business intelligence, online retailers are usually concerned with the following common business concerns:

    - Which items/products’ web pages has a customer visited? How long has a customer stayed with each web page, and in which sequence has a customer visited a set of products’ web pages?

    - Who are the most/least valuable customers to the business? What are the distinct characteristics of them?

    - Who are the most/least loyal customers, and how are they characterized?

    - What are customers’ purchase behaviour patterns? Which products/items have customers purchased together often? In which sequence the products have been purchased?

    - Which types of customers are more likely to respond to a certain promotion mailing? and

    - What are the sales patterns in terms of various perspectives such as products/items, regions and time (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and seasonally), and so on?

In order to address these business concerns, data mining techniques have been widely adopted across the online retail sector, coupled with a set of well-known business metrics about customers’ profitability and values, for instance, the recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) and the customer life value. 
For many online retailers in the United Kingdom and internationally alike, especially the leading companies including Amazon, Walmart, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Argos, Marks and Spencer, John Lewis, and EasyJet, data mining has now become a common practice and an integral part of the business processes in creating customer-centric business intelligence and supporting customer-centric marketing.

Although many famous online retail brands are embracing data mining techniques as crucial tools to gain competitive advantages on the market, there are still many smaller ones and new entrants are keen to practise consumer-centric marketing yet technically lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so.
