### Analysis of Output and Images

#### 1. **Log Output Interpretation**
The log captures the execution of the script for 17 subcategories (Accessories, Appliances, Labels, Machines, Paper, Phones, Storage, Supplies, Tables, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers, Envelopes, Fasteners, Furnishings) in the dataset. The script performs:
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Using an additive model with a period of 30 days.
- **Stationarity Tests**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests.
- **Visualization**: Plots for seasonal decomposition and seasonal patterns, saved to `sales-forecasting\reports\figures\subcategories\`.

##### **Stationarity Test Results**
- **ADF Test**:
  - Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (non-stationary).
  - For all subcategories, the ADF p-value = 0.0000 < 0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis.
  - **Conclusion**: All series are stationary per the ADF test.
- **KPSS Test**:
  - Null Hypothesis: The series is stationary.
  - Results vary:
    - **Non-stationary (p-value < 0.05, reject null)**: Accessories, Appliances, Labels, Paper, Storage, Tables, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Furnishings (p-value = 0.0100 or 0.0209).
    - **Stationary (p-value ≥ 0.05, fail to reject null)**: Machines (p-value = 0.1000), Phones (0.0971), Supplies (0.0971), Chairs (0.0564), Copiers (0.1000), Envelopes (0.0942), Fasteners (0.0530).
  - **Interpolation Warnings**: For several subcategories, the KPSS test statistic is outside the lookup table range, indicating the actual p-value may be smaller (or greater for Machines, Copiers) than reported.

##### **Conflict Between ADF and KPSS Tests**
- The ADF test indicates all series are stationary, while the KPSS test suggests non-stationarity for most subcategories. This discrepancy suggests:
  - The series may exhibit **trend-stationarity** (stationary around a trend, which ADF detects after differencing, but KPSS flags due to the trend).
  - The period (30 days) used for decomposition may not align with the true seasonality, affecting KPSS results.
  - **Recommendation**: Consider detrending the data or adjusting the seasonality period (e.g., 7 days for weekly patterns, 365 for yearly) and re-run the KPSS test.

##### **Processing Details**
- **Timestamps**: Execution starts at 10:58:35 and ends at 10:59:53 on June 03, 2025, taking ~1 minute 18 seconds for all subcategories.
- **File Path Issues**: The `processed_dir` is set to `../data/processed`, which worked initially but failed in the latest run (Cell 3, `execution_count=10`). The path should be corrected to `os.path.join(project_root, "data", "processed", "subcategories")` as previously advised, since `make_dataset.py` saves files to `data/processed/subcategories`.

#### 2. **Image Analysis**
The script generates two types of plots per subcategory, but only one image is displayed in the notebook (Cell 3, `execution_count=10`).

##### **Seasonal Decomposition Plot**
- The `plot_seasonal_decomposition` function generates a four-subplot figure (Observed, Trend, Seasonal, Residuals) for each subcategory.
- These plots are saved as `decomposition_{subcategory}.png` in the output directory.

##### **Seasonal Pattern Plot**
- **Title**: "Seasonal Pattern - Accessories"
- **Axes**:
  - X-axis: Date (labeled as "Date"), ranging approximately from 2014 to 2018.
  - Y-axis: Sales (labeled as "Sales"), ranging from 0 to ~2500.
- **Observations**:
  - The sales data shows a **cyclical pattern**, with peaks occurring roughly annually (e.g., late 2014, late 2015, late 2016, late 2017).
  - There are noticeable **spikes** in sales, with some reaching ~2500, indicating potential seasonality or event-driven sales (e.g., holiday seasons).
  - **Gaps** in the data (e.g., early 2015, early 2016) suggest missing dates or zero sales, which may skew the decomposition if not handled (e.g., via interpolation).
  - **Trend**: A slight upward trend is visible over the years, aligning with the KPSS test’s non-stationary result for Accessories.
- **Saved File**: This plot is saved as `seasonal_pattern_Accessories.png`.

##### **Image Saving Issue**
- The latest log (Cell 3) shows processing for Accessories at 11:21:56, but the script does not log successful saves (unlike the previous recommendation to add `logger.info` for `plt.savefig()`).
- The images are likely saved to `sales-forecasting\reports\figures\subcategories\` (as confirmed by the log: `Output directory set to: sales-forecasting\reports\figures\subcategories`), but the script failed after processing Accessories due to the incorrect `processed_dir` path.

#### 3. **Recommendations for Improvement**
- **Add Save Confirmation**:
  - Modify `plot_seasonal_decomposition` and the seasonal pattern plotting section to log successful saves:
    ```python
    try:
        plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_dir, f"decomposition_{subcategory}.png"))
        logger.info(f"Saved decomposition plot for {subcategory}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to save decomposition plot for {subcategory}: {str(e)}")
    ```
    And similarly for the seasonal pattern plot.
- **Address Stationarity Discrepancy**:
  - Detrend the series before running KPSS:
    ```python
    series_detrended = series - decomposition.trend.dropna()
    perform_kpss_test(series_detrended, f"{series_name}_detrended")
    ```
  - Adjust the seasonality period (e.g., try `period=7` for weekly patterns or `period=365` for yearly).
- **Handle Missing Data**:
  - Before decomposition, fill missing dates with zeros or interpolate:
    ```python
    date_range = pd.date_range(start=df.index.min(), end=df.index.max(), freq='D')
    df = df.reindex(date_range, fill_value=0)
    ```
- **Suppress Plot Display**:
  - Remove `plt.show()` from `plot_seasonal_decomposition` to avoid displaying decomposition plots in the notebook, as they are meant to be saved only.

#### 4. **Summary**
- The script successfully processes the Accessories subcategory in the latest run but fails for others due to a path issue.
- The ADF test confirms stationarity for all subcategories, while KPSS indicates non-stationarity for most, suggesting trend-stationarity.
- The displayed seasonal pattern plot for Accessories shows annual peaks and a slight upward trend, consistent with the KPSS result.
- Images are saved to the correct directory, but save confirmation logging is missing.

### Analysis of Seasonal Decomposition Components and Seasonal Patterns Plots

The analysis is based on the provided log output and the displayed seasonal pattern plot for the "Accessories" subcategory, with assumptions about the decomposition components (Observed, Trend, Seasonal, Residuals) from the `plot_seasonal_decomposition` function. Since only the seasonal pattern plot is displayed, the decomposition components are inferred from typical seasonal decomposition behavior and logged processing steps.

#### 1. **Seasonal Decomposition Components**
The `seasonal_decompose` function with an additive model (`model='additive'`) and a period of 30 days breaks the time series into four components. These are visualized in the saved `decomposition_{subcategory}.png` files but not displayed in the notebook.

- **Observed**:
  - Represents the raw sales data for each subcategory over time.
  - For Accessories, the seasonal pattern plot (X-axis: Date, Y-axis: Sales) shows a time range from approximately 2014 to 2018, with sales ranging from 0 to ~2500. The data exhibits cyclical peaks, suggesting seasonal or event-driven variations.

- **Trend**:
  - Captures the long-term movement or direction in the data.
  - Inferred from the Accessories seasonal pattern plot, a slight upward trend is visible over the years (2014–2018), indicating gradual sales growth. This aligns with the KPSS test’s non-stationary result, as a trend component can cause non-stationarity.

- **Seasonal**:
  - Represents periodic fluctuations within the 30-day period.
  - Given the 30-day period, this likely captures monthly seasonality. The Accessories plot shows annual peaks (e.g., late 2014, 2015, 2016), suggesting the 30-day period may be too short. A yearly seasonality (e.g., period=365) might better reflect these patterns, possibly linked to holiday sales or seasonal demand.

- **Residuals**:
  - Contains the irregular or noise component after removing trend and seasonal effects.
  - For Accessories, residuals are expected to fluctuate around zero, with potential spikes corresponding to unmodeled events (e.g., outliers or missing data gaps observed in 2015–2016). The ADF test’s stationarity (p-value = 0.0000) supports that residuals are likely stationary after decomposition.

#### 2. **Seasonal Patterns Plot**
The displayed plot for "Accessories" (saved as `seasonal_pattern_{subcategory}.png`) provides a direct visualization of the raw time series.

- **Time Range and Frequency**:
  - X-axis spans from early 2014 to late 2018, with daily or near-daily data points, as inferred from the index being parsed as dates.
  - The data frequency appears consistent, though gaps (e.g., early 2015, 2016) suggest missing values, which may affect decomposition accuracy.

- **Sales Magnitude and Variability**:
  - Y-axis ranges from 0 to ~2500, with most values below 1000 and occasional spikes to 2500.
  - High variability indicates irregular sales events, possibly promotions or seasonal peaks.

- **Cyclical Behavior**:
  - Annual peaks (e.g., late 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017) suggest a yearly seasonal pattern, potentially tied to retail cycles (e.g., Q4 holiday sales).
  - The 30-day period used in decomposition may not capture this, leading to the KPSS non-stationarity result.

- **Trend Observation**:
  - A subtle upward trend is evident, with sales increasing from ~500 in 2014 to ~1000–1500 by 2018, supporting the need for detrending in further analysis.

#### 3. **Comparative Analysis Across Subcategories**
The log processes 17 subcategories, with similar decomposition and plotting applied. Key insights:
- **Consistency in Stationarity**:
  - All subcategories show ADF p-value = 0.0000 (stationary), while KPSS results vary (p-value 0.0100–0.1000), with most indicating non-stationarity. This suggests a trend component common across subcategories, as seen in Accessories.
- **Seasonal Variability**:
  - Subcategories like Machines, Phones, and Chairs (KPSS p-value ≥ 0.05) may have weaker seasonal effects or better alignment with the 30-day period, unlike Accessories or Furnishings (p-value = 0.0100).
- **Processing Time**:
  - Decomposition takes ~3–5 seconds per subcategory (e.g., Accessories: 10:58:35 to 10:58:40), indicating consistent computational load.

#### 4. **Potential Issues and Recommendations**
- **Period Mismatch**:
  - The 30-day period may be inappropriate for annual cycles observed in the seasonal pattern plot. Test periods of 7 (weekly), 90 (quarterly), or 365 (yearly) to refine seasonal extraction.
- **Missing Data**:
  - Gaps in the Accessories plot suggest missing dates. Interpolate or fill with zeros to improve decomposition:
    ```python
    date_range = pd.date_range(start=df.index.min(), end=df.index.max(), freq='D')
    df = df.reindex(date_range, fill_value=0)
    ```
- **Trend-Stationarity**:
  - The conflict between ADF and KPSS results indicates trend-stationarity. Detrend the series before KPSS:
    ```python
    series_detrended = series - decomposition.trend.dropna()
    perform_kpss_test(series_detrended, f"{series_name}_detrended")
    ```
- **Visualization Enhancement**:
  - Add legends, gridlines, and confidence intervals to plots for clarity. Save decomposition plots with `dpi=300` for higher resolution:
    ```python
    plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_dir, f"decomposition_{subcategory}.png"), dpi=300)
    ```

#### 5. **Conclusion**
- The Accessories seasonal pattern plot reveals a yearly cyclical pattern with a slight upward trend, consistent with retail sales behavior.
- Decomposition components likely show a dominant trend and residual noise, with the 30-day seasonal component underrepresenting annual cycles.
- Adjusting the period and handling missing data will improve the accuracy of seasonal and stationarity analyses across all subcategories.
